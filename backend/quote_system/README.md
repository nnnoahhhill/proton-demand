## 1. Project Goal & Vision

The primary goal of this project is to create a **fast, accurate, and reliable** backend system for generating instant quotes for custom parts manufactured via:

* **3D Printing** (FDM, SLA, SLS)
* **CNC Machining** (3/4/5-Axis)
* **Sheet Metal Processing**

This system includes integrated **Design for Manufacturing (DFM)** analysis to validate geometry and provide feedback before quoting. It aims to replace potentially slow, overly complex, or unreliable existing solutions by focusing on core accuracy, performance (< 10 seconds for DFM), and maintainability through a modular architecture.

The system provides both a **RESTful API** (using FastAPI) for integration with web frontends and other services, and a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** (using Typer) for local development, testing, and direct use.

## 2. Current Status & Implementation Details

This project is under active development. Here's the status of each major component:

### 2.1. Overall System
* **Architecture:** Modular Python codebase with clear separation between core utilities, process-specific logic, API/CLI interfaces, and visualization.
* **Interfaces:** Functional FastAPI server (`main_api.py`) and Typer CLI (`main_cli.py`) are implemented.
* **Geometry:** Supports loading `.stl` and `.step`/`.stp` files. STEP files are converted to STL internally using `pythonocc-core`. Basic mesh properties (volume, bounds, area) calculated using `Trimesh`.
* **Configuration:** Managed via `.env` file and Pydantic settings (`config.py`), controlling markup, optional tool paths, and API keys.
* **Costing Model:** Follows a simplified model as requested:
    * `Base Cost = Material Cost` (Calculated from volume/weight and material price)
    * `Customer Price = Base Cost * Markup Factor` (Markup factor is configurable)
    * Process time is estimated and reported but **not** included in the `Base Cost`.
* **Testing:** Basic framework using `pytest` is set up (`testing/`). Includes programmatic generation of test models (`testing/generate_test_models.py`) and initial DFM tests for 3D printing (`testing/test_3d_print_dfm.py`). Quote tests are placeholders.

### 2.2. 3D Printing (FDM, SLA, SLS)
* **Status:** Core functionality implemented. Considered the most complete module currently.
* **DFM Analysis:** Implemented using `PyMeshLab` and `Trimesh`. Includes checks for:
    * Build Volume (`dfm_rules.check_bounding_box`)
    * Mesh Integrity (Non-manifold, Holes, Self-intersection basic checks) (`dfm_rules.check_mesh_integrity`)
    * Multiple Disconnected Shells (Configurable, currently CRITICAL fail) (`dfm_rules.check_mesh_integrity`)
    * Overhang Analysis (Warn/Error based on angle) (`dfm_rules.check_overhangs_and_support`)
    * Warping Risk (Basic check for large flat areas near base) (`dfm_rules.check_warping_risk`)
    * Internal Voids / Escape Holes (Basic check for SLA/SLS) (`dfm_rules.check_internal_voids_and_escape`)
    * **Limitation:** `check_thin_walls` currently contains **placeholder logic**. A robust implementation using PyMeshLab filters or other methods is required for accurate thin wall detection.
* **Cost & Time Estimation:**
    * Relies **heavily** on an external slicer (**PrusaSlicer** or compatible) being installed and accessible. The `slicer.py` module handles finding and running the slicer CLI.
    * Uses slicer output (G-code comments) to get accurate print time and material consumption (including implicit support material).
    * Calculates material cost based on slicer's material usage and configured material prices (`processes/print_3d/materials.json`).
    * **Limitation:** Accuracy is dependent on the quality and configuration of the slicer profiles used (currently uses generic defaults). Explicit support material volume/cost is not separated from the main material estimate.

### 2.3. CNC Machining
* **Status:** **Placeholder Implementation Only.** Provides basic structure but is **not accurate** for real-world quoting.
* **DFM Analysis:** Includes very basic checks:
    * Build Volume (`dfm_rules.check_cnc_bounding_box`)
    * Placeholder/basic checks for thin features and tool access/corners (`dfm_rules.check_cnc_thin_features`, `dfm_rules.check_tool_access_and_corners`). These **do not** perform detailed geometric analysis.
* **Cost & Time Estimation:**
    * **Cost:** Placeholder calculates material cost based on *mesh volume* times a fixed *waste factor* times material price. This is **highly inaccurate** as it doesn't account for stock size or features.
    * **Time:** Placeholder calculates time based on *bounding box volume* times a fixed factor plus setup time. This is **highly inaccurate** and doesn't reflect actual machining operations.
* **Needed Implementation:** Requires significant development, including: geometric feature recognition (pockets, holes, bosses), tool accessibility analysis, undercut detection (for 3/5-axis), internal corner radii checks, calculation of machining time based on features/toolpaths/material, and more sophisticated stock material estimation.

### 2.4. Sheet Metal
* **Status:** **Not Implemented.** Directory structure exists (`processes/sheet_metal/`) but contains no functional code.
* **Needed Implementation:** Requires logic for unfolding (flat pattern generation), bend analysis (radius, k-factor, collisions), tooling checks, feature validation (e.g., distance to bends), and cost/time estimation based on cutting, bending, and material usage.

## 3. Architecture

The system uses a modular architecture:

* **`core/`:** Contains shared components like Pydantic data types (`common_types.py`), geometry loading/conversion (`geometry.py`), custom exceptions (`exceptions.py`), and utilities (`utils.py`).
* **`processes/`:** Holds subdirectories for each manufacturing process (e.g., `print_3d/`, `cnc/`). Each process has:
    * A `processor.py` inheriting from `base_processor.py`.
    * `dfm_rules.py` containing specific validation checks.
    * `materials.json` defining material properties.
    * Specific helpers (like `slicer.py` for 3D printing).
* **`main_api.py` / `main_cli.py`:** Entry points for the FastAPI web server and Typer command-line interface, respectively. They orchestrate calls to the appropriate processor.
* **`config.py` / `.env`:** Handles application configuration (markup, paths, keys).
* **`visualization/`:** Contains the `PyVista`-based local 3D viewer (`viewer.py`).
* **`testing/`:** Contains `pytest` tests, fixtures (`conftest.py`), benchmark models, and model generation scripts.

## 4. Key Technologies

* **Python 3.9+:** Core programming language.
* **FastAPI:** High-performance web framework for the API.
* **Typer:** Modern CLI framework based on Click.
* **Pydantic:** Data validation and settings management.
* **Trimesh:** Loading meshes (STL), basic geometry analysis and manipulation.
* **pythonocc-core:** Reading and processing STEP files (CAD format).
* **PyMeshLab:** Advanced mesh analysis (wrapping MeshLab), used for robust DFM checks.
* **PrusaSlicer (External):** Used via CLI for accurate 3D print time/material estimation. Dependency must be installed separately.
* **PyVista & PyQt6/PySide6:** For 3D visualization in the local CLI tool.
* **Rich:** For enhanced console output in the CLI.
* **pytest:** For automated testing.

## 5. Features

* **Multi-Process Support:** Designed for 3D Printing, CNC, and Sheet Metal (though only 3DP is substantially implemented).
* **File Support:** Accepts `.stl` and `.step`/`.stp` files.
* **DFM Analysis:** Provides Pass/Warning/Fail status with detailed issues, recommendations, and severity levels.
* **Simplified Costing:** Calculates material cost accurately (based on slicer for 3DP, placeholder for CNC) and applies a configurable markup for customer pricing.
* **Time Estimation:** Provides process time estimates (accurate for 3DP via slicer, placeholder for CNC).
* **REST API:** Offers `/quote`, `/materials/{process}`, `/health` endpoints. Auto-generated documentation at `/docs`.
* **CLI Tool:** Provides `quote` and `list-materials` commands for local use.
* **Visualization:** Optional `--visualize` flag in the CLI launches an interactive 3D viewer highlighting DFM issues (requires GUI environment).

## 6. Limitations & Known Issues

* **Performance Target:** While DFM checks aim for < 10 seconds, **3D Print quotes involving the external slicer will often exceed this target**, especially for complex models. CNC/Sheet Metal estimates (when geometry-based) are expected to be faster.
* **Slicer Dependency (3DP):** Accurate 3D print quotes **require PrusaSlicer** (or a compatible slicer CLI configured) to be installed and findable by the system. If not found or it fails, quoting will fail. This is a significant external dependency.
* **`pythonocc-core` Installation:** Can be difficult to install via `pip` across different platforms due to its C++ dependencies. Using `conda` is strongly recommended. See `setup_instructions.md`.
* **3DP DFM Accuracy:**
    * The crucial **Thin Wall check** (`dfm_rules.check_thin_walls`) is currently a **placeholder** and needs proper implementation for reliable results.
    * Overhang analysis is basic (angle-based) and doesn't guarantee perfect support generation by the slicer.
    * Warping/Void checks are heuristic and may produce false positives/negatives.
* **CNC Accuracy:** DFM checks and **especially cost/time estimates for CNC are currently placeholders and highly inaccurate.** They need complete reimplementation based on proper CNC principles.
* **STEP Conversion:** Conversion from STEP to STL using `pythonocc-core` might lose precision or fail on very complex/problematic STEP files. The quality of the resulting mesh affects subsequent analyses.
* **Units:** The system generally assumes input files use **millimeters (mm)**. Results might be incorrect if files use different units.
* **Error Handling:** While specific exceptions are caught, edge cases in geometry processing or slicer interaction might lead to unexpected errors.
* **Scalability:** The current synchronous API request handling and in-memory state might not scale well under heavy load in a production environment.

## 7. Future Work & Areas for Improvement

* **[CRITICAL] Implement 3DP Thin Wall Check:** Replace the placeholder in `processes/print_3d/dfm_rules.py` with a robust thickness analysis method (e.g., using advanced PyMeshLab filters if suitable, or potentially Trimesh ray casting).
* **[MAJOR] Implement CNC DFM & Quoting:** Develop proper feature recognition, tool accessibility analysis, corner/undercut checks, and physics/feature-based time/cost estimation.
* **[MAJOR] Implement Sheet Metal:** Add processor, DFM rules (unfolding, bends), and quoting logic.
* **Enhance 3DP Costing:** Explore options for explicitly calculating support material volume/cost, potentially through more detailed slicer output parsing or geometric approximations.
* **Refine Slicer Integration:** Allow configuration of specific slicer profiles; potentially add support for CuraEngine as an alternative. Handle slicer warnings more effectively.
* **LLM Integration:** Add optional calls to LLMs (Gemini, OpenAI) using configured API keys to generate user-friendly explanations and fixing suggestions based on technical DFM issues.
* **Testing:** Add comprehensive tests for quoting logic (`test_3d_print_quote.py`, `test_cnc.py`), including checks against expected costs/times for benchmark models (based on internal logic, not external sites). Expand DFM test coverage.
* **Visualization:** Improve the PyVista viewer (better legends, more highlight types, potentially saving viewpoints).
* **Configuration:** Move more magic numbers/thresholds from code (e.g., `dfm_rules.py`) into the main configuration (`config.py` or separate config files). Add support for machine profiles.
* **API Scalability:** Investigate asynchronous processing for long-running tasks (slicing, complex DFM) using background tasks or task queues (Celery).
* **Error Reporting:** Improve error messages and potentially provide correlation IDs for easier debugging between API calls and logs.
