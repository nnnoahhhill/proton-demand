# Project Changelog

## [Current Date - YYYY-MM-DD] - Backend Refactoring
- Refactored the `backend/quote_system/` directory structure to align with `CRITICAL-UPGRADE-PLAN.md`.
- Deleted old directories (`src/`, `api/`, `services/`) and files (`check_env.py`, temporary `config.py`).
- Created new core files:
    - `backend/quote_system/config.py` (centralized configuration)
    - `backend/quote_system/main_api.py` (FastAPI application)
    - `backend/quote_system/main_cli.py` (Typer CLI application)
- Created `backend/quote_system/testing/` directory with:
    - `conftest.py` (Pytest fixtures)
    - `generate_test_models.py` (Script to create benchmark STL files)
    - `test_3d_print_dfm.py` (Tests for 3D print DFM rules)
    - `test_3d_print_quote.py` (Tests for full 3D print quoting)
    - `test_cnc.py` (Tests for CNC quoting)
- Created `backend/quote_system/visualization/` directory with `viewer.py` (PyVista-based model viewer).
- Moved `requirements.txt` from project root to `backend/quote_system/`.

## 2023-03-18
- Frontend-Backend API Integration
  - Implemented API service in frontend to communicate with Python backend
  - Created TypeScript interfaces for API request/response types
  - Developed QuoteForm component with full API integration
  - Added comprehensive form validation and error handling
  - Updated quote page to use the new form component
  - Created detailed API integration documentation

## 2023-03-17
- API Simplification
  - Created a unified `/getQuote` endpoint in the Python backend that replaces multiple separate endpoints
  - Implemented support for all manufacturing processes (CNC, 3D Printing variations, Sheet Metal)
  - Added proper file upload handling for 3D models and optional PDF drawings
  - Created comprehensive input validation for processes, materials, and finishes
  - Added detailed response structure with price, lead time, and manufacturing details
  - Created test script (test-api-python.sh) to demonstrate endpoint usage with curl

## 2023-03-14
- Initial project review
- Created project plan
- Identified key components and user flow
- Set up task tracking structure

## Current Status
The backend DFM analysis system is largely complete with functionality for:
- 3D printing analysis
- CNC machining analysis
- Cost estimation
- Manufacturability assessment

Frontend development and API integration are the main focus areas for upcoming work.

## Recent Updates

  - TypeScript improvements for better code quality
  - User guidance for interacting with 3D models

### 2023-03-16
- Enhanced ModelViewer component in the quote interface:
  - Applied the same 3D interaction improvements from the carousel
  - Added full rotation capabilities in all directions
  - Implemented zoom and pan functionality
  - Added normalized scaling for consistent model sizing
  - Fixed TypeScript errors and improved type safety
  - Added user guidance for model interaction
- Improved the quote page with proper TypeScript typing

## Next Actions
- Begin frontend development with file upload and 3D visualization ✅
- Create simplified API endpoint to streamline integration ✅
- Set up testing environment for the complete flow ✅
- Add user authentication and order tracking 

## 2024-06-14
- Added detailed plan to implement the quote-to-purchase flow:
    - Frontend: Quote request, Stripe Checkout redirect, quote display.
    - Backend: Quote API endpoint, Stripe Checkout Session creation, Stripe webhook for payment confirmation, Slack notification on success.
- Updated `project_plan.md` with specific tasks for this flow.
- Added Environment Variable section to `README.md` for Stripe and Slack keys/webhooks.
