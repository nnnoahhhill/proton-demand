# Manufacturing DFM Web Application Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a seamless web application where users can upload 3D models (STL/STEP files), get instant DFM (Design for Manufacturing) analysis, receive quotes, and place orders for manufacturing. The backend DFM analysis system is largely completed, and we're now focusing on connecting the frontend user flow with the backend API.

## Project Tasks

  - [ ] Add finish options based on selected process
  - [ ] Add quantity selector
  - [ ] Create "Get Instant Quote" button with loading state

- [ ] **Quote Results Display** (not started)
  - [ ] Design loading indicator for quote generation
  - [ ] Create success state showing price and manufacturing details
  - [ ] Design failure state showing DFM issues with explanations
  - [ ] Add "Modify Design" and "Place Order" buttons

- [ ] **Shipping & Checkout** (not started)
  - [ ] Create shipping address form
  - [ ] Implement shipping cost calculation display
  - [ ] Add payment method selection
  - [ ] Design order summary display

### Backend Integration
- [ ] **API Simplification** (not started)
  - [ ] Create a streamlined `/getQuote` endpoint
  - [ ] Ensure proper handling of file upload + manufacturing options
  - [ ] Format response for easy frontend consumption

- [ ] **Order Processing System** (not started)
  - [ ] Implement order number generation
  - [ ] Create order database storage

- [ ] **Notification Systems** (not started)
  - [ ] Integrate with Slack API for order notifications
  - [ ] Create email receipt system for order confirmations

### Testing & Deployment
- [ ] **Frontend Testing** (not started)
  - [ ] Test file upload with various STL/STEP files
  - [ ] Verify 3D rendering across browsers
  - [ ] Test responsive design on mobile devices
  - [ ] Verify all selection options work correctly

- [ ] **API Testing** (not started)
  - [ ] Test quote generation with various models
  - [ ] Verify DFM analysis correctly identifies issues
  - [ ] Test complete order creation flow
  - [ ] Verify notification systems functionality

- [ ] **End-to-End Flow Testing** (not started)
  - [ ] Validate complete user journey
  - [ ] Ensure all success and error paths work correctly

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Frontend Basics & API Integration
- Focus on file upload, 3D visualization, and basic UI
- Create simplified API endpoint
- Implement manufacturing options interface
- Connect frontend to API for quote generation

### Phase 2: Order Processing & Notifications
- Build order creation system
- Integrate Slack notifications
- Implement email confirmation system
- Add shipping address and cost calculation

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing
- Improve UI/UX based on testing feedback
- Enhance error handling
- Add analytics for user behavior tracking
- Conduct thorough end-to-end testing

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js, Three.js for 3D visualization
- **Backend**: FastAPI (existing), Python DFM analysis tools
- **APIs**: REST API with file upload support
- **Notifications**: Slack API, Email service (SendGrid/Mailgun)
- **Deployment**: To be determined based on hosting preferences

## User Flow
1. User visits site and navigates to Instant Quote section
2. User uploads STL/STEP file and sees 3D rendering in browser
3. User selects process, material, finish, and quantity
4. User clicks "Get Instant Quote" button
5. Backend processes model and returns DFM analysis and quote
6. If manufacturable, user sees price and can proceed to order
7. If not manufacturable, user sees issues that need to be fixed
8. User can enter shipping details to get total cost
9. User can place order, generating Slack notification and email receipt

## Next Steps
1. Begin with frontend file upload and 3D visualization
2. Create simplified API endpoint for quoting
3. Test the basic flow with sample models
