YOU MUST ALWAYS ALWAYS USE INDUSTRY STANDARD EXTREMELY ACCURATE ANALYSIS METHODS WHEN COMPUTING DFM AND QUOTES!!!!!

Do not ever simply compute volume and multiply by some cost factor. this is a terrible way to quote. you will cost my business millions of dollars in loss if you quote with this lazy approach

I have built extensive tooling for dfm assesment and quote analysis in the /dfm folder within this project. you must use my existing tools, making sure you always review what is available any time quoting or dfm assesment comes into play

all  of the backend API must use these python scripts when doing dfm or quote assesment, ALWAYS!!!
